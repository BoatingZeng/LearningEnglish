## Macron slammed for asking: 'Who could have predicted the climate crisis?'

On Saturday, December 31, 2022, during his New Year's address, French President Emmanuel Macron uttered a short phrase that rubbed many climate change activists the wrong way. It was a reminder to the president to be aware of the impact of his words.

Noting the "singular" aspect of these speeches, which "force us to talk about an uncertain future," the president reviewed the crises that France and Europe underwent during the past year. "Who could have predicted the wave of inflation that was unleashed? Or the climate crisis and its spectacular impact on our country this summer?" asked the president. After a long discussion on pensions and the need for the French to work more, Mr. Macron only mentioned the climate crisis once; stating that the "energy transition is a battle that we must win."

The president barely spent a few minutes discussing one of the most important issues of the century, during which he questioned the predictability of global warming. His words were immediately perceived as a **disconnect** by several experts. 

"It is appalling and it went straight to the heart of everyone who works on these issues," said Matthieu Auzanneau, director of the Shift Project. "The Kyoto Protocol dates back to 1997, Jacques Chirac said that 'our house is burning down' over 20 years ago. You have to be completely ignorant to write and then speak sentences like that. He is paying lip service, **acting as a tactician and not as a strategist**."

"Some people may view it as an awkward phrase. He wanted to express that the French people may have felt that some events were happening quicker than scientists had predicted," said Pascal Canfin. "But the accusations that he is unaware of the situation have no merit."

This president’s speech came at a time during the holiday season when global warming was once again a hot topic in the media, with monthly heat records being broken across France.

National weather agency Météo-France was expected to announce this week that 2022 was the hottest year on record. To the president’s credit, he was stunned by the "drastic effects." Even some meteorologists were surprised by the intensity of the heat waves in July and August 2022.

His naivety in calling the global crisis unpredictable is more surprising. The first IPCC report dates back to 1990. Since then, 27 United Nations Climate Change Conferences (COPs) have taken place. Between August 2021 and April 2022, the IPCC published three parts of its sixth assessment report. In the first part, devoted to the physics of climate change, experts warned of "rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere" and noted that extreme events, such as heat waves, heavy rain, or droughts, had become more frequent and intense.

As a result, Mr. Macron’s opponents are speaking out to highlight his ignorance. "I fell out of my chair," said Marine Tondelier, national secretary of Europe Ecologie-Les Verts (EELV). 

"Macron is having trouble in existing and being honest on this issue," said Emmanuel Rivière, international director for political studies at the Kantar Public Institute. "With regard to climate change, his 'at the same time' feels like a watered-down answer, while people are receiving countless opinions and information. In this context, prominent stances emerge more easily."

The French are well aware that the climate is linked, in one way or another, to many other current events, such as our dependence on certain countries for fossil fuels or inflation. There is an awareness that the end of the month and the end of the world are intertwined. In our majority too, more and more MPs believe that there can be a third ecological way." Some scientists, disheartened by this New Year's Eve speech, still need to be convinced.

1. What does the word 'disconnect' mean in the 3rd paragraph?

```
His words were immediately perceived as a disconnect by several experts.
```

Can not keep up with others.

2. Why does Matthieu Auzanneau call Macron a tactician (rather than a stratigist)?

Because He is short-sighted. A strategy is usually long-term and high-level.

3. Please tell that if these statements below are true or false:
   1. Pascal Canfin criticizes Macron for having no merit.
   False. He says the accusations against Macron have no merit.
   2. Macron is stunned by this year's weather.
   True.
   3. Evidence shows that the increase in extreme weather is not unpredictable.
   True. The scientists made some predictions years ago.
4. What does Emmanuel Rivière mean by his words?

Macron is the one who doesn't care about climate while most other people care. He should not talk more about this issue.

5. Do you believe that the climate is linked to other current events as the last paragraph suggests? Why or why not.

All things on earth are linked to each other as a system. As for the climate, we should take account of the sun and the moon as well.
But it is hard to say how strong the correlation bewteen A and B is. It is a math problem.
Maybe the using of fossil fuels correlates with the climate.
But as for the correlation between the inflation and the climate, I can't get it.
