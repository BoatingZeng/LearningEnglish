I ~~start~~ `started` to translate the online chat logs.

The names below are (not real)/(fake).

Lily: Jack, your codes are too random.

Jack: I just ~~used~~ `use` them once anyway.

Lily: I reconstructed your codes.

Jack: It's better to optimize the codes which are used to search words.

Lily: They also need optimization.

Jack: I write temporary codes casually ~~which~~ `when they` are used to process files.

Lily: They aren't temporary. If there is a modification upstream, we need to update them.

Lily: Jack, you are not familiar with the methods of vanilla JavaScript, ~~right~~ `aren't you`?

Jack: I always forget them. I will use them if I think of them.

Tom: My father was 41°C the day before yesterday.

Jack: 41°C? Can the temperature of `human` body be so high?

Tim: I'm starving to death at home. It is sleeting and 3°C outside. No one delivers food.

Jack: Is it that serious? Oh, your place is too cold.

Tim: This is my first time encountering ~~this~~ `such` situation. Is there really no takeaway staff?

John: Many staffs are positive. Some staffs go to support Beijing.

Tim: I can't wait any more. I will go downstairs to buy some food.

Tim: We didn't hold any annual meeting during the epidemic.

Tom: I have not attended the annual meeting for several years of work. Too few people in the company, so we just have a meal instead of the annual meeting.

Tim: I have had only one annual dinner in this company.

Tom: I didn't have annual dinner this year. I happened to be COVID-19 positive that day.

---

Tim: I think that the mandatory rotation of leave will start in a few days.

Tom: I have no annual leave.

Jack: My colleagues in the office have already packed their things and left early.

Tim: If I arrange all my vacations before the Spring Festival, I can `be` ready for `the` Chinese New Year after a few days of work after New Year's Day.

Tom: Hello, everyone!

Tim: It seems that Tom ~~is already awake~~ `has already waken up`.

Tom: Good morning, Tim.

Tim: It's not morning now. Have you had breakfast?

Tom: No, I haven't. ~~I'm~~ `I've been` waiting for you to cook for me.

Tim: I made some porridge. Do you want some?

---

Lucy: By the way, some of my classmates are going to resign. They all want to go back to Zhu Hai. It seems to be the best at home.

Tom: Run(resign)! When will ~~Lucy~~ `you` resign?

Lucy: I don't know.

Tim: So you have classmates from Zhu Hai.

Tim: There are not many jobs in Zhuhai that do embedded technology.

Tim: Maybe they can only go to the company such ~~like~~ `as` GREE(格力).
