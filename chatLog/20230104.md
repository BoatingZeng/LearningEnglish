Tom: My friends often asked for CSDN accounts in QQ groups when they just started working.

They asked who can share any accounts with points.

Tim: Generally, such account~~s~~ can't be shared.

Such communities have strict rules generally.

If someone shares his account, he will be banned.

Of course, the above is just my thought as a rookie.

Tom: Sharing accounts on a small scale is normal.

We shared within the circle of classmates at that time.

Or you can ask someone to download them for you then treat him to a meal in return.

Tom: I come to this QQ group for learning. It feels great!

Tim: Great! I have learnt so much here!

Tom: But there were few sexy pictures for several days.

Ann: Hand over the sexy pictures! You think that my little cat doesn't see them, don't you?

Tom: What kind of group is this?

Tim: I'm COVID-19 positive now.

Ann: Please drink enough warm water.

Tim: I'm drinking. I don't know my tempreture `temperature` since I don't have a thermometer.

But I have some ibuprofen as well.

Jack: Don't take medicine indiscriminately. It is dangerous to take medicine without symptoms.

Tim: I have symptoms. I have a fever and a cough. The doctor said it was COVID-19 typically.

Jack: Do you have pains in your arms, legs or head.

You will also have a fever or a cough if you have a common cold.

Tom: Ibuprofen has two functions, one is to reduce fever and the other is to relieve pain.
