First Vlog
Hello everyone. This is my first vlog and I want to start a series of vlogs in English.
I will try my best to talk in English in my English vlogs.
Since this is the first one, I prepared the script in advance.
I hope I can talk fluently without a script one day.

Parking Problem
Here is an unfinished road.
As you can see, there are many cars parking here.
The owners of these cars park their cars here because parking is free here.
In the village, parking fee is about 200 yuan per month. Here is one of the barrier gates.

Daily Life
Discribing my daily life in detail is a good way to learn English.

Washing Clothes
When you wash clothes, you should rub them in the water.
After washing the clothes with detergent(washing powder solution), I rinsed them with clean water.
Then I wrung out the clothes to dry them.
At last, I put my clothes on the hangers and hung them on the rod.

Shaving My Face
I assembled my razor first.
I washed my face with clean water, then smeared shaving foam on my face.
I shaved my face with my razor. It's pain.
