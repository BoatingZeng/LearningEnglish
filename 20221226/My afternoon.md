### My afternoon

At ~~about~~ **around** 11:30, my brother telled `told` me it was time for lunch on Wechat. 

So I rided`rode` to their home.

```
You need exercises on participles.
```

My brother and his wife came back home from school for lunch today. 

They are both teachers. 

But ~~these days~~ **nowadays**, students don't go to school.

My family except my father usually have meal together. 

These days, because they ~~are~~ **have** ~~cold~~ **colds**, we use public chopsticks. 

```
Q: Have a cold, have colds, right? Many people have colds.
```

We usually have many vegetables and a little meat for meal**s**. 

I usually finish my meal in 20 minutes. 

After lunch, I went back to my room and had a sleep.

When I got up, it was 14:00. 

I went to the balcony, filled two ~~bucket~~ **buckets** ~~of~~ **with** water to water the plants on the balcony.

I water them once every two days when I am home. 

After watering, I ~~took~~ **brought** the clothes from **the** balcony to **my** room. 

```
Q: If I just want to say "room", not "my room". How to say?
A: to the room
```

Then I went back to my room to do some work**s**.

I heard an old man ~~coughed~~ **coughing** in the neighborhood.

I read **some** articles on wikihow and CNN. 

Wikihow is a website where we can learn ~~daily~~ **everyday** skills. 

```
Daily literally just means by day, while everyday could mean normal days in an abstract way.
```

I think the articles are easy to unstander`understand`, though I read **them** very slowly in fact. 

The articles on CNN are difficult for me because the sentences are usually very long. 

I read an article about the coronavirus wave of China this month. （这个月的疫情，这里this month是不是会让人理解成read的时间？）

```
You can say: I read an article about this month's coronavirus wave of China.
```

I read ~~the~~ **a** book of Quantum Field Theory, ~~certainly~~ in Chinese **of course**.

```
Do you know the differences between the and a?

"Quantum Field Theory" is the name of the book. Mybe I should say, a book called "Quantum Field Theory".

Q: Differences between "cestainly" and "of course", I have searched online but don't understand.
A: I would certainly read the Chinese version. We use "certainly" in a complete sentence. "Certainly" is more formal.
