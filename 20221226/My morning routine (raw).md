I woke up at 7:30 a.m. today, then took a few minutes to get dressed. 

It's cold these days. 

The temperature is 10°C to 20°C.

I wear two sweaters, a woolen vest, a thick coat and a thin coat.

Oh, I almost forgot my two pairs of trousers.

I went to the bathroom, filled a mug of warm water, put toothpaste on toothbrush, and then brushed my teeth.

After brushing teeth, I got the towel wet with warm water and washed my face.

I go to my mother's house by bike to have breakfast everyday.

Today, my mother and my elder borther's two children are in the house.

They have cold these days.

We haven't checked if it was COVID-19.

I am healthy now. 

I took a big metal bowl and a metal ladle to the kitchen, then put the rice porridge into the bowl from the pot.

The porridge was very hot.

Then I sat beside the table and had the porridge for breakfast.

It took me a long time to eat up the porridge.

After that, I went back to my house.

After going back to my house, the first thing I did is going to the toilet. 

I usually defecate in the morning. 

Well, skip this part.

Finished toilet, I memorized words with an app called BaiCiZhan.

Then I started to do math exercises.

During this time, I also talked to netizen on QQ, checked the price of some stocks and browsed the website.

I got 'Death Stranding' for free on epic, but I won't play this game since I had tried it once and watched the process video online.

Oh, I started to write my daily life in English so this text was born.
