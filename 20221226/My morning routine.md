### My morning routine

I woke up at 7:30 a.m. today, then took a few minutes to get dressed. 

It's cold these days. 

The temperature is 10°C to 20°C. 

I wear two sweaters, a woolen vest, a thick coat and a thin coat. 

Oh, I almost forgot my two pairs of trousers.

I went to the bathroom, filled a mug ~~of~~ **with** warm water, put **some** toothpaste on **the** toothbrush, and then brushed my teeth. 

After brushing teeth, I got the towel wet with warm water and washed my face.

I go to my mother's house by bike to have breakfast everyday. 

Today, my mother and my elder brother's two children are in the house. 

They have **caught** cold ~~these~~ **for several** days. 

We haven't checked if it was COVID-19 **yet**.

```
Or: We didn't check if it was Covid-19.
// For the difference between the past and the perfect tenses, if you don't know, come ask me.
```

I am healthy now. 

I took a big metal bowl and a metal ladle to the kitchen, then put the rice porridge into the bowl from the pot. 

The porridge was very hot. 

Then I sat ~~beside~~ **at** the table and had the porridge for breakfast. 

```
Well correct me if you did sit beside the table.

Q: What's the differences between "sit beside" and "sit at"?
A: beside: I don't touch the table.
   at: I sit on the chair and the table is in front of me. We should use "at" when saying "have breakfast".
```

It took me a long time to eat up the porridge. 

~~After that,~~ **Then** I went back to my house.

After going back to my house, the first thing I did is going to the toilet.

```
I went to the toilet directly when I got home.
```

I usually defecate`(you what?)` in the morning. 

```
take a dump/shit
```

Well, **let's** skip this part.

**After I had** Finished toilet, I ~~memorized~~ **learnt** words from an app called BaiCiZhan.

A. on   B. by   C. with   D. from   E. something else

```
This is your homework, try to look up for some examples for references.
By the way, do you know the past perfect tense?
```

Then I started to do math exercises. 

During this time, I also talked to ~~netizen~~ **some friends** on QQ, checked the price of some stocks and browsed the website. 

```
You use netizen in the same situation where you would use the word citizen.
It's usually used to describe a category of people, on news reports mostly.
By the way, if you don't mean to say friends, you can say you talk to some random people for example.
```

I got **the game** 'Death Stranding' `(Use double quotation marks)` for free on epic, but I won't play ~~this game~~ **it** since I ~~had~~ tried it once and **have** watched the ~~process~~ **walkthrough** video**s** online. 

```
This is a good example of the differences between the past and the perfect tenses.
```

~~Oh~~ **By the way**, I started to write **about** my daily life in English ~~so this text was born~~ which is this text.
