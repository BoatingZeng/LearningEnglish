At about 11:30, my brother telled me it was time for lunch on Wechat.

So I rided to their home. My brother and his wife came back home from school for lunch today.

They are both teachers. But these days, students don't go to school.

My family except my father usually have meal together.

These days, because they are cold, we use public chopsticks.

We usually have many vegetables and a little meat for meal.

I usually finish my meal in 20 minutes.

After lunch, I went back to my room and had a sleep.

When I got up, it was 14:00.

I went to the balcony, filled two bucket of water to water the plants on the balcony.

I water them once every two days when I am home.

After watering, I took the clothes from balcony to room.

Then I went back to my room to do some work.

I heard an old man coughed in the neighborhood.

I read articles on wikihow and CNN.

Wikihow is a website where we can learn daily skills.

I think the articles are easy to unstander, though I read very slowly in fact.

The acticles on CNN are difficult for me beacause the sentences are usually very long.

I read an article about the coronavirus wave of China this month.（这个月的疫情，这里this month是不是会让人理解成read的时间？）

I read the book ok Quantum Field Theory, certainly in Chinese.
